### Setting up and Running

Clone and cd into this git repository. Then, use pipenv to install dependencies and setup a virtual environment.

```
$ pipenv install
```

Now use the python executable located in the virtual environment created by pipenv to run main.py
```
$ /path/to/virtualenvs/Genetic-CNN-for-Computer-Vision-????/bin/python main.py
```

For toggling parameters such as evolution and the intelligent survival function (not working currently), look at config.yaml in the configs directory.
